dedworc2 - DEnsity-based Drone Workflow for Observation and Reinforcement-Learning of Crowd Characteristics (Too Crowded, backwards)

## Authors

Matt Desaulniers

## Overview
This project will eventually allow for the following use and functionality:

* Run crowd simulations (or basic particle simulations)
* Simulate observation of crowd via a distributed network of drones
* Create kernel density estimations over 2D spaces, and construct crowd/particle dynamics related metrics and heuristics from observations
* Train a Pytorch reinforcement learning model to observe a dynamic crowd in a fixed space
* Test and Evaluate learned model
* (ULTIMATE GOAL) Run the learned model and display a simulation (and performance metrics) where all individual agents work collaboratively to navigate the environment and sense the underlying crowd's dynamics efficiently, tracking regions of interest or events of interest in the crowd over time
